# Fetching-API
In this project, a webpage is created that fetches and displays user data from a public API using JavaScriptâ€™s Fetch API. The HTML file contains a container where the user information will be shown. When the page loads or the reload button is clicked, a request is sent to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
